## Project Motivation

This project aims to follow the CRISP-DM to address the three questions which related to business or real-world applications. The dataset is picked up from Kaggle, contributed by AirBnB, which contains the rent data about Seattle. I would like to process whole data
and try to find some valuable data to help owner understand which feature could improve the rate of rent, moreover, whether train a model to predict. Three questions are:

1. What features influence the rating of house?
2. When is the most popular time for this area?
3. Could we create a model to predict the price?
